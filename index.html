    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical University of Moldova</strong></li>
        <p>
            Being a FAF student (Software Engineering), I like to spend time with friends. The most entertaining course till now was everything about math, because it was very challenging and mindblowing.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Theoretical Lyceum Onisifor Ghibu, Orhei</strong></li>
        <p>
            In school I liked math, since it was interesting for me to think critically, also the math teacher was the best.

        <h2>Projects:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Digitalization of medical records</strong></li>
            <p>Working on this Internship project at Allied Testing, our team has developed a register for storing
                medical data of patients inside a certain platform, instead of storing it on paper. In this way a lot
                of time is saved among with resources and safety issues resolved. Personally worked on the front-end part, via
                JavaScript, especially using React.js: <a href="https://github.com/Ghenntoggy1/MedRec-PBL-Sem-3">https://github.com/Ghenntoggy1/MedRec-PBL-Sem-3</a> </p>

            <li><strong>AI Campaign Validator</strong></li>
            <p>As part of my internship project at Extole, our team developed an AI-powered Campaign Validator to streamline the validation process for marketing campaigns.
                 This tool enables clients to visualize and analyze campaign structures, ensuring efficiency and compliance. I was responsible for the front-end development,
                  focusing on the visualization of flowcharts using JavaScript, particularly with Vue.js and Vue Flow. This implementation enhanced the user experience by providing a clear, interactive representation of campaign hierarchies: <a href="https://github.com/Flexksx/ai-campaign-validator-internship"> https://github.com/Flexksx/ai-campaign-validator-internship</a></p>

            <li><strong>Mystic Forest Game (Novela)</strong></li>
            <p>A visual novela game created, also developed in teams for Multimedia course. It was our first game, where we have learned how to work in Unity and how does the process of game creation takes palce: <a href="https://katrincik.itch.io/the-mystic-forest">The Mystic Forest</a> </p>
            
            <li><strong>Sand Box Game</strong></li>
            <p>This team work game represents a farm simulation where we have used not just game coding skills, but also some physics and mathematics included: <a href="https://katrincik.itch.io/our-farm-day">A Farm Day</a></p>
